This directory contains a few utility scripts that you might find of use or
interest.

The list-* scripts should be fairly self-explanatory. You give them a
Twitter username and they'll print all friends or followers, either with
the full info as it comes back from the Twitter API, or as just Twitter
userids (much faster).

print-caches.py can be used to print the cache files saved by Tickery.

The most instructive is create-twitter-namespaces-and-tags.py. Its one-time
use is described in doc/running.rst
