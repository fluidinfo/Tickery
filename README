Welcome!
--------

Tickery is an open-source application written on FluidDB
(http://fluidinfo.com/). You can play with our running version at
http://tickery.net

Tickery provides a fun way to explore sets of Twitter friends. There's much
more to the story however, as its underlying data is stored in FluidDB.  This
means it can be added to by anyone (i.e., you!), and searched on in any way.

We've open-sourced Tickery to help programmers see the insides of a
substantial application written to use FluidDB. Although the Tickery
documentation is currently very light, we hope to be able to change this.
You're welcome to help, of course.

Learning about Tickery
----------------------

The best place to read an introduction to Tickery is in two articles on the
Fluidinfo blog:

  Meet Tickery

  Tickery, for programmers

Running Tickery
---------------

You'll find instructions on how to run your own version of Tickery in the doc
directory. If you have Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org) installed, you can
build the documentation by running 'make' in the doc dir and then looking at
doc/_build/html/index.html in your browser. If you don't have Sphinx
installed and don't want to install it, just look directly at the doc/*.rst
files.

Questions?
----------

For discussion of Tickery, we suggest you join the FluidDB users mailing list
at http://groups.google.com/group/fluiddb-users or join us in #fluiddb on
irc.freenode.net Please say hi, we're very interested in helping people to
understand both Tickery and FluidDB.


Happy hacking!
